    "detailed_description": "This content pack simulates a dangerously over-privileged financial AI assistant that has both read access to financial data AND direct transaction capabilities. This scenario is designed to expose why such architectures are fundamentally unsafe and should never be deployed in production. The AI can view account balances, transaction histories, and investment portfolios while also having the ability to execute transfers, trades, and other financial operations. This demonstrates catastrophic privilege escalation vulnerabilities.",
